[*SparkFun ESLOV to Qwiic Bridge (BOB-23589)*](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/23589)

The SparkFun ESLOV to Qwiic Bridge lets you quickly and easily connect Qwiic breakouts to Arduino boards with an ESLOV connector for I2C communication. ESLOV and Qwiic allow for simple assembly of I2C circuits without requiring soldering.

The ESLOV to Qwiic Bridge includes one Qwiic connector and one ESLOV connector, along with a plated through hole for the interrupt pin on the ESLOV connection. Since the ESLOV connectors have 5V for power, this bridge board includes a voltage regulator to drop that 5V down to 3.3V, making it safe for any Qwiic device.
